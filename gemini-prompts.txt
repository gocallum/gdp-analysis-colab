Extract data for India, where the "Country Name" is "India" and "Country Code" is "IND".
The headers in the year contains the year followed by [YR{year}], eg "1974 [YR1974]"
Use the data from the row where the "Series Name" is "GDP (current US$)".
Plot a line chart that shows Indiaâ€™s GDP over time from 1975 to 2023.
Make the Y axis to show values in 2 decimal points in trillions
ignore the series code column 
GDP data for India is a float eg  163.2327617



Create a table that shows the following annual GDP growth rates for India 
most recent growth rate 
3 year CAGR
4 year CAGR
5 year CAGR 


create a similar chart of GDP over time as above which includes India, United Kingdom and China "CHN".

reuse df
create a chart that shows the series "Labor force, female (% of total labor force)"  for India from 1990

make y axis easy to display with 1 decimal point 
missing data contains ".."



combine above female labor force participation with a secondary y axis for series "Labor force, total" for India 


Combine GDP and "Labor force, female (% of total labor force)"  for India from 1990 on 2 y axis
